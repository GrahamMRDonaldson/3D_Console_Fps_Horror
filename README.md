# 3D_Console_Fps_Horror
3D ASCII Horror Game

This game was originally created to be a ASCII based horror game in a maze. Currently only the maze is implemented and although the project is interesting, other "horror" aspects likely won't be added. 

The 3D aspect is created using illusions, with ray tracing for each column of the console, with the symbol of the wall being based on how far the ray went. This allows the creation of a '3D' like world, along with the ceiling/floor size being based off of how far that ray went as well. The complete illusion gives both different textures, but also different sizes of walls (to the maze) depending on how far away a wall is. 

How to use:

W - Move forward

S - Move backward

A - Rotate Counter Clock-wise

D - Rotate Clock-wise
